      "An FPV Drone Racing Challenge is a high-intensity competition that puts a pilot's ability to the test as they navigate their drone through a fast-paced obstacle course. The event is crafted to showcase precision in control, rapid decision-making, agility, spatial awareness, and sharp reflexes in dynamic, real-world racing conditions.\n\nTo ensure fairness and technical merit, only custom-built multi-rotor drones are allowed. Ready-to-Fly (RTF) commercially purchased drones are strictly prohibited.",
